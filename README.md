myBikeTrainer is simple trainer software that I have developed for my needs.
It supports only trainers with Bluetooth connection and was tested on Elite and Wahoo Smart trainers.
Trainer has to support indoor machine feature to work with myBikeTrainer. Additional HR device can be connected as well.

You can use the application for free as it is without any warranty.
The application requires to have installed .NET CORE 3.1 runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1.

To import workouts you can drop .zwo file into the application.
